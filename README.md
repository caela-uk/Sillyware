# _"What is Sillyware?"_

Sillyware is a type of program that **does not affect your computer** at all, Sillyware is made to **trick or annoy** someone, it should **NEVER ACTUALLY HARM THE COMPUTER, SHARE DATA OR INFLICT PERMENANT DAMAGE**.

> This is completely stupid and unserious software so feel free to name your own silly scripts as Sillyware
